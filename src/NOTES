USE A LIBRARY TO PARSE XML, MORON

DOM - Document Object Model
SAX - Simple API for XML
JDOM - "a Java-based document object model for XML files"

XPath - an added bonus

DOM: slow, loads entire file into memory and parses it
SAX: parses the file in chunks, reads data and then throws it out
JDOM: quicker, lighter-weight version of DOM, middle ground?

**XPath: way of picking out a particular piece of XML data in your file (strongly recommended)
